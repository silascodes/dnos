DNOS - The Disastrous Not Operating System

This abomination was coded over several weekends a few years back, probably when I had not enough beer and too much Intel manual.

In this state it really does nothing, hence the name, but with "some work" it may or may not load a ELF binary and do something with it.

To build you will need to download the compiler (a version of GCC) from https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/silascodes/dnos-compiler.tar.gz and extract it into the compilers directory.

Good for all you masochists out there.
